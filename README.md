# 📊 Pandas Practice Repository — Structured Learning to Practical Analytics

This repository documents my structured, hands-on learning journey with **Python Pandas** for data analysis and preprocessing. It contains organized practice scripts, real datasets, and output files that demonstrate practical data handling workflows used in real analytics projects.

The goal of this project is to build strong Pandas foundations and progressively apply them to real-world style data tasks.
